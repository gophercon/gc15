Hi GopherCon Attendees,

Thanks for coming to GopherCon 2016! Twitch is excited to be a platinum sponsor and we are really looking forward to meeting you all.

Twitch is a large site operated by high-leverage engineers, so code you write will have a meaningful effect on millions of users. Our entire chat system is written in Go, and Go plays a large and critical role in every part of the video system and website.

We use Go in a wide variety of applications: command line tools, batch processors, daemons, servers with business logic and servers for quickly moving bits. Some processes have multi-gigabyte heaps and others use only a few megabytes. Some processes have hundreds of thousands of goroutines, others have just a handful. We push the limits and report our bugs.

We also train new engineers on how to use Go and donâ€™t assume everyone has experience when they walk in the door.

If are interested in hearing more stop by our booth and talk to one of the Twitch staff!
