Trending languages for data science/engineering work are python and R, but can Go provide something special and relevant in this developing space?

The answer is definitely yes.

In this session, I will discuss several major go-based efforts in the field of data science and use cases for Go over python/R in a data processing context.

I will also discuss go-based data science workflows and tools, including Go notebooks, to help your get your feet wet.
