gRPC is a general RPC framework focused on performance and interoperability across a wide range of programming environments.

In this session we will demonstrate, through a series of live demos and code walkthroughs, how to design, build, and deploy a collection of microservices using gRPC from the ground up.

Key gRPC concepts will be covered including authenticating gRPC services and clients, service discovery, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
