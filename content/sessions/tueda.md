Go Mobile (golang.org/x/mobile) is a project which shows new possibilities for mobile apps development.

Especially, for mobile games which requires high performance processing, Go can be expected to be an alternative to C and C++.

This session explains how to develop game apps using some packages such as app, event and sprite provided by Go Mobile project.

Furthermore the session introduces a way to call Android API from Go codes, and solutions for some problems which occurs when we distribute apps on Google Play.

I would like to show current capabilities and future potentials of Go Mobile.
