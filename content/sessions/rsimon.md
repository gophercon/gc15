This tutorial introduces a novel approach to building microservices in Go that uses code to describe the design of the service API.

The design is then fed to generation tools that produce not only actual service modules but also other outputs such as client Go packages, command line tools, Javascript and documentation via Swagger specifications and JSON schemas.

In this tutorial we will use goa to build a microservice from scratch complete with UI, client tool and documentation.

Weâ€™ll also take a look at how to leverage the goa request context at runtime to implement the API endpoint.
