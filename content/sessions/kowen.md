How do you learn Go? First do the tour. Then read the language spec. Then write a lot of code.

This works for a lot of people, but for some the gap between the tour and the spec is a vast chasm.

In his GopherCon 2015 keynote, Russ Cox said: Go needs everyone's help, and everyone isn't here.

This talk draws on two years of iterative exploration. It examines one way to bridge this gap, aiming to make Go accessible to a broader audience.
