In this talk, I will present the Go [Guru](http://golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru), an "editor-integrated tool for code comprehension and navigation".

This tool provides traditional editors such as Emacs, Vim, Sublime, and Atom with code navigation features not usually found outside a heavyweight IDE.

I'll demonstrate how to use it to answer the kinds of questions that come up all the time during a typical day of coding.
