Lantern is a circumvention tool that people can use to access the Open Internet without restrictions. Lantern uses Go on its desktop client, server infrastructure and on its Lantern Mobile application for phones.

We'll focus on Lantern Mobile: this talk begins with our experiences working with Go Mobile and ends on a list of gotchas and suggestions on how can you start writing backends for mobile apps as well.
